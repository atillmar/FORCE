## Background
The FORensic Capture Enrichment (FORCE) panel is an all-in-one SNP panel for forensic applications. This panel of 5422 markers encompasses common, forensically relevant SNPs (identity, ancestry, phenotype, X- and Y-chromosomal SNPs), a novel set of 3931 autosomal SNPs for extended kinship analysis, and no clinically relevant/disease markers. The FORCE panel can be adapted to various enrichment methods, including hybridization capture, primer extension capture (PEC), and possibly multiplexed PCR, making it a viable option for both high quality and degraded DNA samples. The enriched SNP targets can be sequenced on a variety of downstream MPS platforms. By limiting the number of SNPs, fewer MPS reads are required to obtain per-SNP coverage requirements, and thus sequencing efficiency is maximized. The FORCE panel SNPs were sub-selected from SNPs on the genotyping microarrays used by DTC DNA testing companies, enabling cross-compatibility with externally developed SNP data. This is important for forensic validation purposes to demonstrate concordance and genotyping accuracy.

The [FORCE paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/12/12/1968/htm) was published in December 2021.  

The FORCE SNP panel currently exists as a myBaits capture kit (Daicel Arbor Biosciences), a QIAseq assay (QIAGEN) and as an AmpliSeq assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
